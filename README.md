# WorkCalculator

Beginning to learn Swift and other iOS programming concepts, I began to create a Firebase-based Work-Hour-Tracking cloud based service. This project taught me a lot about the Swift language through trial and error.
The project itself is not written as best as it could be and I have not updated it with my current knowledge because it would serve no purpose for me. 
It is interesting to use this project as a comparison for my future works.
